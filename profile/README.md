# WiReSens Toolkit
Welcome to the GitHub landing for WiReSens Toolkit!

WiReSens Toolkit is an embedded development toolkit that uses JSON to configure firmware and software for wireless resistive tactile sensing applications.

## Overview

To program a tactile sensing system using WiReSens Toolkit, you

1. Define configurations in a JSON File
2. Flash a base firwmare program to calibrate and read from your sensor using the Arduino Library
3. Configure the sensor and run methods for recording, visualization, or analysis using the Python Library

Each repository has instructions for installation and more detailed documentation. Here, we give a high level overview of a full example workflow programming a resistive tactile sensor using WiReSens Toolkit
